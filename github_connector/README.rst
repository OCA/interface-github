Load Github Data in your Odoo Instance
======================================

This module allow you to

* recover social informations from Github. (Members of organizations,
  Pull Requests, Issues, Comments, ...)
* download source code from Github

Configuration
=============

Once installed, you have to:
* Open your openerp.cfg file and add extra settings to mention github
 credencials:
    * Add the following entries

github_login = your_github_login
github_password = your_github_password

* go to 'Settings' / 'Technical' / 'Parameters' / 'System Parameters'
    * github.max_try: mention the number of call to the API, before an error
      is raised. Set an high value if your connection is bad
    * git.source_code_loca_path: set a local folder, that will be used to
      download source code from github
    * git.partial_commit_during_analyze: Set to True if you want to commit
      in the database the result of the analysis after each repository analysis.
      Set to True if you have a lot of repository to reduce the size of
      the transaction, when you realize the first big analyse.

  groups. The members of this group will have the possibility to run Github

  'Organization Series' Tabs

For each branches of your repositories, you can download the Source Code, and
once downloaded you can analyze it. Analyze in this module is basic. (For the
time being, it just gives branches sizes). But you can develop an extra Odoo
Custom module to extend analyze function and get extra stats, depending of your
needs.
