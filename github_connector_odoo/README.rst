=========================================================
Analyze Odoo modules information from Github repositories
=========================================================

This module was written to extend the functionality of 'Github Connector'
Module if your repositories contain Odoo Modules.

It extends 'Analysis' features to parse code files (readme / manifest files)
and add new models and menus.

Configuration
=============

* Once installed, go to your organization, and set extra settings:

1. The name of your organization in the author keys of the manifest odoo
   modules
2. The URL of the file that contains IDs of your repositories for the runbot

If you had analyzed previously your repositories with the
'github Connector' module, you should launch again the Analysis Process
for all your Repository Branches.
