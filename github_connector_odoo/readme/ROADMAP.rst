* Implement deep code source analysis, like the website http://odoo-code-search.com/
  and specially:

1. Possibility to search by field or by model name. (Ex: field:invoice_id)
2. Possibility to display the number of XML, Python, Yaml, HTML, CSS lines

* Implement Social feature, like possibility to comment a module, add a
  notation, like the website https://www.odoo.com/apps

* Create a new module github_connector_odoo_website, that could display
  the modules informations for non logged users.
